## 🔧 Fixed

## ✏️ NOTES

I discovered something interesting while creating the scripts for the new camera presets. I was curious to try them out with Most Wanted and was very surprised to see that they worked without any errors when installing them or anything like that. They actually feel pretty good, coming from Carbon. I tried them all and they worked. You know you can install other presets like `Modern Cameras For Carbon` or `[Carbon] Extended Cameras` in Most Wanted. 
P.S. And if you've made it this far and are still reading, I can only thank you. At least now I know there are people reading this and I don't waste time creating changelogs. Have a nice day!

# 🧾 [Rev 3.0 Changelog] - 19/05/2025

## ⚖️ Balance changes

- Alfa Romeo Brera: Minor Fixes
- BMW M3 GTR: Rebalanced Handling `=`
- Mercedes CLK-500: Handling Buff `+`

## 🔄 Changed
- All files have been restructured and the installer has received an updated interface.
- The mod has been patched to achieve compatibility with the `Carbon Battle Royale` mod.
- Added a new optional script for the `Carbon Battle Royale` mod.
- The drift physics of the `Carbon Battle Royale` mod are back to those of the vanilla game.

## 🔧 Fixed

- Fixed audio bug with the Audi LeMans which had the Lamborghini Murcielago audio.

## ✏️ NOTES

The truth is that the drift in `Carbon Battle Royale` is very bad, the cars simply do not slide and the difficulty is simply unfair to the point that in hard mode it becomes almost impossible to win a simple drift race and I wanted to fix that, since I saw a mod that almost completely removed drift races and the truth is that I do not like it, I hope that this revision of the mod fixes that problem.

## ✏️ NOTES

It also happened to me with the Audi LeMans, but when I deleted my saved game the game no longer crashed when using the Audi, so I don't know if I should consider what happened to me with the Murcielago LP640 a bug.

The modification and/or fix to the bodykits is only for the vanilla version, I'm going to prepare Rev v1.1 in search of bugs and changes (that includes the bodykits) for the improvement mod V2.
